Vectorization:- Converting any data into numbers.
Dataset contains input data and output data(Label).
We can split dataset into test data, train data and validate data
Supervised Learning:
Classification problem:- When output is categorical (e.g cat or dog, red or blue etc)
Regression problem:- Output is a set of range


Confusion matrix:-
Truepositive, Truenegative, Falsepostive, Falsenegative

Numpy array is known as tensor.
