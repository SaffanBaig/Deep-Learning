1- Machine Learning:- Machine can learn from data not from hand crafted(hard coded) rule. We need to perform feature engineering.
2- Deep Learning:- It includes neural network, Auto feature engineering( i.e: we don't need to tell about features)
3- Data Science:- Mixture of AI, ML and DL.
4- Turing Test:- We can't predict that whether we are talking with machine or human.
5- Classical Programming:- Input + Program(rules) = Output
6- Machine Learning:- Input + Output = Program
7- In ML we need three things
	1-Input 2-Output 3-Way to measure
8- Deep Learning is a multi stage learning
9- Loss Function compares predict value with actual value and returns difference between them.
10- Re adjusting weights are called back propagation.
11- AGI :- Artificial General Intelligence (Similar to Human)
12- ANI :- Artificial Narrow Intelligence (Working on small parts e.g: self driving car)
13- First Neural Network was written in 1950.
ML methods:
14- Probabilistic Modeling is a statistics model (Naive Bayes)
15- Kernel method is a ML method. Its a group of classification algorithms. Our data is seperated into two parts and line which
seperates are called hyperplan. e.g support vector machine.
16- Decision Tree
17- Random Forest:- Collection of decision tree (CART: Classification Regression tree) Use for classification. Select
tree on basis of votes.
18- Boosting Machine:- (Not use in Deep learning) learn from previous mistakes
Why Deeplearning?
1- We don't need to tell about features.
2- Higher accuracy than ML and works better with big data. This is because it learns in layer
